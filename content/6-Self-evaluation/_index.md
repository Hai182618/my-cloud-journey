During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **September 8, 2025** to **December 16, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply various cloud computing concepts in a real working environment.  
I participated in the **First Cloud Journey workshop** and contributed to developing the **Cloud Read project**, which helped me strengthen my skills in **Cloud Computing, Solution Architecture, Serverless technologies, and teamwork**.

Throughout the internship, I maintained a strong work ethic, strived for high-quality results, adhered to workplace guidelines, and actively collaborated with team members to improve overall effectiveness.
