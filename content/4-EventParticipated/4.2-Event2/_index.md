### Description of Event Activities

This full-day event delivered a comprehensive, in-depth experience across the core pillars of DevOps on AWS, combining theory, demos, and real-world best practices.

#### **Morning Session (8:30 AM – 12:00 PM)**

The day began with a warm welcome and a recap of the previous AI/ML session. The trainers introduced the **DevOps mindset**, emphasizing culture, collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.  
Topics included:
- DevOps principles and practices  
- Benefits and performance metrics such as DORA, MTTR, deployment frequency  

The next major segment focused on **AWS DevOps CI/CD services**, including:
- AWS CodeCommit and Git strategies (GitFlow, Trunk-based Development)  
- Build & Test automation with AWS CodeBuild  
- Deployment strategies using CodeDeploy (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling)  
- CI/CD orchestration using AWS CodePipeline  
- Live demo of a complete CI/CD pipeline  

Following a short break, the session continued with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
- CloudFormation templates, stack management, drift detection  
- AWS CDK constructs, reusable patterns, multi-language support  
- Demo deploying infrastructure with CloudFormation & CDK  
- Discussion on choosing the right IaC tool for different scenarios  

#### **Afternoon Session (1:00 PM – 5:00 PM)**

The afternoon introduced **AWS container services**, covering:
- Docker fundamentals and microservices containerization  
- Amazon ECR image management, scanning, and lifecycle policies  
- Amazon ECS & EKS orchestration, scaling, and deployment patterns  
- AWS App Runner for simplified container deployment  
- Demo & case study comparing microservices deployment options  

After another break, the group explored **Monitoring & Observability**:
- CloudWatch logs, metrics, alarms, dashboards  
- AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing  
- End-to-end demo of full-stack observability setup  
- Best practices for alerting, dashboards, and on-call processes  

The final segment highlighted **DevOps best practices**:
- Feature flags, A/B testing, deployment safety techniques  
- Automated testing and CI/CD integration  
- Incident management workflows and postmortems  
- Case studies from startups and enterprise DevOps transformations  

The day concluded with a Q&A session discussing **DevOps career pathways** and **AWS certification roadmap**.

### Participation & Role

As an attendee, I listened attentively, observed demos, and followed the practical explanations of DevOps workflows on AWS. Although not directly hands-on, the event gave me a complete view of modern cloud DevOps practices.

### Outcomes & Value Gained

From this event, I gained:

- A deep understanding of DevOps culture, best practices, and the importance of continuous improvement  
- Clear insights into CI/CD workflows using CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline  
- Practical knowledge of Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation and CDK  
- Solid foundational understanding of container services (Docker, ECR, ECS, EKS, App Runner)  
- Knowledge of monitoring & observability using CloudWatch and X-Ray  
- Awareness of deployment strategies, incident management, and postmortems  
- Broader career orientation toward Cloud DevOps and AWS certification paths  

This event significantly strengthened my understanding of DevOps and reinforced my interest in cloud engineering and automation.
