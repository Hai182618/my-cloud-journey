## Event 1 – AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

**Event Name:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS  
**Date & Time:** 8:30 AM – 12:00 PM, November 15, 2025  
**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office  
**Role:** Attendee (Student)

### Description of Event Activities

This half-day workshop provided a comprehensive introduction to modern AI/ML and Generative AI workloads on AWS. The event was structured into multiple sessions, starting with participant registration, welcome activities, and an overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam. The session also included an ice-breaker and orientation on workshop objectives.

The first main segment focused on **AWS AI/ML services**, with deep dives into:
- Amazon SageMaker and its end-to-end machine learning workflow  
- Data preparation and labeling  
- Model training, tuning, deployment  
- Integrated MLOps features  
- A live demo using SageMaker Studio  

After a short break, the workshop continued with an extensive session on **Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock**, covering:
- Bedrock-supported Foundation Models (Claude, Llama, Titan) and selection considerations  
- Prompt Engineering techniques such as CoT and few-shot prompting  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge base integration  
- Bedrock Agents and multi-step orchestration  
- Guardrails for safety and filtering  
- A live demo building a GenAI chatbot  

### Participation & Role

As an attendee, I actively listened to the presentations, followed the demos, observed workflows, and took mental notes on the technologies being demonstrated. Although I did not directly practice hands-on labs, I gained valuable exposure to real-world AI/ML tools and architectures used by AWS.

### Outcomes & Value Gained

From this event, I gained:
- A broader view of how AI/ML and GenAI are being applied in Vietnam  
- A clearer understanding of AWS’s machine learning stack, especially SageMaker workflows  
- Practical knowledge of modern GenAI techniques through Amazon Bedrock  
- Insights into model selection, RAG design, prompt engineering, and safety guardrails  
- Greater confidence and motivation to pursue Cloud & AI/ML as a career direction  

This event significantly reinforced my cloud knowledge foundation and helped me connect theoretical concepts with real-world AI/ML workflows.
