## Event 3 – AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar Workshop

**Event Name:** AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar Workshop  
**Date & Time:** 08:30 AM – 12:00 PM, November 29, 2025  
**Location:** AWS Vietnam Office  
**Role:** Attendee (Student)

### Description of Event Activities

This half-day workshop focused on the **Security Pillar** of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, providing a detailed and structured view of cloud security best practices based on five foundational pillars.

The session began with an overview of the Security Pillar and its role within the Well-Architected Framework. Core cloud security principles were introduced, including:
- Least Privilege  
- Zero Trust  
- Defense in Depth  
- Shared Responsibility Model  
- Common cloud security threats in Vietnam  

#### ⭐ **Pillar 1: Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
The workshop’s first pillar explored modern IAM architecture:
- IAM Users, Roles, and Policies  
- Eliminating long-term credentials  
- IAM Identity Center for SSO and centralized permission management  
- SCPs and permission boundaries for multi-account environments  
- MFA, credential rotation, and Access Analyzer  
- Mini demo on IAM Policy validation and access simulation  

#### ⭐ **Pillar 2: Detection**  
This segment covered continuous monitoring and detection:
- CloudTrail (organization-level logging)  
- GuardDuty for threat detection  
- Security Hub for compliance and posture management  
- VPC Flow Logs, ALB Logs, S3 logs  
- EventBridge for alerting and automation  
- Detection-as-Code concepts  

#### ⭐ **Pillar 3: Infrastructure Protection**  
Topics included:
- VPC segmentation and network isolation  
- Public vs private subnet placement  
- Security Groups vs Network ACLs  
- AWS WAF, Shield, and Network Firewall  
- EC2, ECS, and EKS workload protection practices  

#### ⭐ **Pillar 4: Data Protection**  
This section emphasized encryption and secret management:
- AWS KMS: key policies, grants, rotation  
- Encryption at rest & in transit (S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB)  
- Secrets Manager & Parameter Store patterns  
- Data classification & guardrails  

#### ⭐ **Pillar 5: Incident Response**  
The workshop concluded with incident response fundamentals:
- AWS IR lifecycle and playbook structure  
- Handling compromised IAM keys  
- S3 public exposure remediation  
- Malware detection on EC2  
- Snapshot, isolation, and evidence collection  
- Automated IR using Lambda and Step Functions  

### Participation & Role

As a student attendee, I primarily listened to the presentations and followed the explanations and demos. Although not performing hands-on exercises, I gained a comprehensive understanding of cloud security principles and AWS security services.

### Outcomes & Value Gained

From this workshop, I gained:
- A clear understanding of the **5 security pillars** within the AWS Well-Architected Framework  
- Practical insights into IAM design, detection mechanisms, and workload protection  
- Knowledge of encryption, KMS, secret management, and data lifecycle security  
- A real-world perspective on common cloud security issues in Vietnam  
- Awareness of incident response workflows and automated remediation patterns  
- A stronger security mindset aligned with modern cloud architectures  

### Impact on Career Development

This event helped reinforce my direction toward Cloud Security and DevSecOps. The workshop provided clarity on the AWS Security learning roadmap, including paths toward **Security Specialty** and **Solutions Architect Professional**, strengthening my long-term career orientation in cloud security.
