### Week 3 Achievements:

* Gained a strong foundational understanding of **Amazon VPC**, including CIDR concepts, IP addressing, subnets, route propagation, and how VPCs provide secure, isolated environments.

* Mastered **VPC Security and multi-VPC architecture**, including:
  * Security Groups  
  * Network ACLs  
  * VPC Peering  
  * Transit Gateway  
  * cross-VPC communication models  

* Developed knowledge of **hybrid connectivity** such as Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Direct Connect, and how they integrate on-premises networks with AWS.

* Understood the role of **Elastic Load Balancing**, including traffic distribution, health checks, availability improvements, and integration with VPC layers.

* Completed hands-on labs building a production-grade VPC:
  * Created public & private subnets  
  * Designed and configured Route Tables  
  * Attached and configured IGW  
  * Deployed NAT Gateway for secure outbound access from private subnets  

* Strengthened network security expertise by configuring Security Groups and NACLs, and validating inbound/outbound traffic behavior.

* Created a full **VPC Resource Map**, improving skills in documenting network architecture, dependencies, traffic flows, and security boundaries.
