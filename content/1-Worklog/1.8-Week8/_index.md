### Week 8 Achievements:

* Built a strong foundational understanding of **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**, including IAM Users, Groups, Roles, Policies, Permission Boundaries, and security best practices across AWS environments.

* Learned how **Amazon Cognito** supports authentication, authorization, and user management for web/mobile applications—covering User Pools, Identity Pools, and identity federation with third-party IdPs.

* Gained critical knowledge of **AWS Organizations**, including multi-account governance, Service Control Policies (SCPs), consolidated billing, and enterprise-grade account structuring strategies.

* Understood the purpose and capabilities of **AWS Identity Center**, including:  
  * Centralized access management  
  * Integration with external IdPs  
  * Single Sign-On (SSO)  
  * Streamlined permission management across multiple AWS accounts  

* Deepened cloud security expertise through **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**, including key creation, rotation, key policies, encryption context, and multi-service integration for secure, auditable encryption.

* Developed strong monitoring skills using **AWS Security Hub**, understanding how it aggregates findings, evaluates environments against CIS & AWS security standards, and delivers continuous compliance insights.

* Reinforced learning through hands-on lab activities:  
  * Enabled Security Hub  
  * Evaluated security posture via automated scoring  
  * Analyzed findings and compliance results  
  * Performed full cleanup for cost control & environment hygiene  

* Conducted additional security research, strengthening understanding of identity governance, encryption strategies, threat detection, and cloud security operations.
