* Learned in depth about **Amazon S3**, including:  
  * Access Points  
  * Bucket policies  
  * Storage Classes  
  * Lifecycle configurations  
  * Cost optimization and performance tuning  

* Built strong practical skills with **S3 Static Website Hosting**, **CORS**, **object key design**, and performance optimization techniques such as multipart upload, transfer acceleration, and caching.  
  Explored archival storage such as **Glacier** & **Glacier Deep Archive**.

* Understood the broader AWS hybrid storage ecosystem:  
  * **Snow Family** (Snowcone, Snowball, Snowmobile)  
  * **AWS Storage Gateway**  
  * **Backup and hybrid integration workflows**  

* Completed hands-on S3 & Backup labs:  
  * Creating S3 buckets  
  * Deploying infrastructure using CloudFormation  
  * Creating Backup Plans with rules, schedules & lifecycle  
  * Setting up SNS notifications  

* Gained real-world hybrid virtualization experience through **VM migration to AWS**, including:  
  * Exporting VMs from VMware Workstation  
  * Uploading VM images to S3  
  * Importing VMs into AWS  
  * Deploying instances from AMIs  

* Strengthened advanced **S3 administration** skills by configuring S3 ACL, exporting VM images, and performing environment cleanup for cost hygiene.

* Enhanced hybrid storage capabilities by deploying **AWS Storage Gateway**, creating and mounting file shares, validating configurations, and performing full cleanup afterward.
