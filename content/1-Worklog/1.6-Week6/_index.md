### Week 6 Achievements:

* Gained a solid understanding of **Compute Virtual Machines on AWS**, including EC2’s role in the compute ecosystem and how instance lifecycle, provisioning, and management operate in cloud environments.

* Mastered the various **EC2 Instance Types**, including general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, and accelerated computing families.  
  Learned how to choose optimal instance types for different workloads.

* Built strong knowledge of **AMI management**, including creating custom AMIs, understanding AMI-backed instances, versioning strategies, and using AMIs for backup, scaling, and DR workflows.  
  Improved security posture through proper Key Pair management and SSH best practices.

* Developed a deep understanding of **Elastic Block Store (EBS)**: volume types, performance, snapshots, encryption, and design best practices for persistent storage.  
  Distinguished EBS from **Instance Store**, recognizing ephemeral storage behaviors and appropriate use cases.

* Strengthened hands-on skills with **User Data and Instance Metadata**, understanding how EC2 performs bootstrap automation, dynamic configuration, and environment-aware deployment.

* Mastered core principles of **EC2 Auto Scaling**, including launch templates, policies, health checks, lifecycle hooks, and cost-efficient scaling strategies.

* Gained exposure to broader compute and storage tools:  
  * EC2 Autoscaling  
  * Elastic File System (EFS)  
  * FSx  
  * Lightsail  
  * AWS MGN  

* Completed full **AWS Backup** hands-on workflow:  
  * Deploying backup infrastructure via CloudFormation  
  * Creating Backup Plans with rules & lifecycle policies  
  * Testing restore operations to validate RTO/RPO targets  
  * Cleaning up resources to maintain cost efficiency
